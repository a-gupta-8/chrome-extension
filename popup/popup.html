        <h1>Arrays</h1>
        <p class="biggerText">
          Arrays are one of the most common data structures in computer science.
          Arrays are stored contiguously in memory, which means blocks of memory
          are allocated for them and there can be no gaps between the memory
          addresses of its values.
        </p>
        <p class="biggerText">
          The elements in an array can be identified by their index which
          represents thier position in the array. Usually, the first element has
          an index 0, the second element has an index 1 and so on.
        </p>
        <img src="../images/Array.png" alt="Array IMG" width="300px" />
        <p class="biggerText">
          If an array extends past the memory block it's allocated, then a new
          array, of larger size, is created and the the values are copied over
          to the next array.
        </p>
        <p class="biggerText">
          Similarly, in some cases, if the array becomes too small then a
          smaller sized array is allocated and the values copied over
        </p>

        <p class="biggerText">
          Linked Lists are another way of storing lists of data. The difference
          between Linked Lists and Arrays are that linked lists do not have
          indexing, so you cannot access elements by their index, because they
          are not stored contiguosly in memory.
        </p>
        <p class="biggertext">
          Instead, linked lists use pointers to point to their next value. Each
          element in the linked list is stored as a node which consists of the
          value itself and a pointer to the next node.

        <p class="biggerText">
          The above shows a singly-linked list where the each node points to the
          next node, but there can also be doubly linked lists where each node
          has an additional "previous" pointer that points to the previous node.

        <h1>Hash Sets</h1>
        <p class="biggerText">
          Hash Sets is a typical set but a little bit better. A set cannot have
          duplicate values which is also the case in hash sets, but hash sets
          use a hashing function which allows for constant time lookup of
          values.
        </p>
        <p class="biggertext">
          A hashing function pretty much takes in the element as an input and
          does some sort of arithmic calculation on it to produce a hash
          value/id. Then some modulus of that hash value is used as the index of
          the value to store at.
        </p>
        <img src="../images/HashSet.png" alt="LinkedList IMG" width="400px" />
        <p class="biggerText">
          A good hashing function is one that produces different hash values for
          different inputs. But in some cases two inputs can have the same hash
          value, in which case there are two methods used when inserting those
          values.
        </p>
        <p class="biggerText">
          1. Insert the value in the next available address
